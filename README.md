UTF8 Convert
============

Repent sinners!  If you did not consider the whole world as your user you probably didn't create your database in UTF8.  This leads to a long road of ugly consiquences such as utf8 encoding in latin1, double triple, even, dare I say it, quadrouple utf8 encoding!  Oh gentle reader, take heed and convert your MySQL database to utf8 before the time is latter than it was when I wrote this.
